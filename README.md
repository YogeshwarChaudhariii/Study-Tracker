About Project:

Project Name: Student Tracker Using C++ Language.
Author: Yogeshwar Prakash Chaudhari.
File Name: Final.cpp

1) Purpose of the Project:
A console-based application to help students track their daily study sessions efficiently.
Provides features for logging, reviewing, and analyzing study activities.

2) Study Log Management:
Allows users to insert new study records with details like date, subject, duration (hours), and description.
Stores multiple study logs in memory using a C++ vector.

3) Display of Logs:
Users can view all their study logs in a structured format.
Each entry shows the date, subject, time spent, and description.

4) Summary Reports:
Summary by Date: Aggregates total study hours for each day.
Summary by Subject: Aggregates total study hours for each subject.

5) CSV Export Feature:
Exports all study logs into a CSV file (Study.csv).
Ensures data can be opened in Excel, Google Sheets, or any spreadsheet tool.

6) Menu-Driven Interface:
User-friendly console menu with numbered options.
Options include Insert Log, View Logs, Summaries, Export to CSV, and Exit.

7) Time Handling:
Automatically fetches the current system date for each log entry.
Ensures consistency and avoids manual date entry.

8) Technology Used:
Implemented in C++ using concepts of OOP, STL (vector), file handling, and time functions.
Portable and lightweight; runs on any C++ compiler without external libraries.

9) Key Benefits:
Helps students analyze study patterns by date and subject.
Improves productivity by maintaining a personal study diary.
Provides a structured CSV export for academic tracking.

11) Scope for Future Enhancement:
Adding import from CSV to retain logs across sessions.
Adding graphical summary charts (using external libraries).
Extending to a GUI or web-based tracker for better visualization.
